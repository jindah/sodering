                Sodering's terrace glass suits buildings of various types. Regardless of whether it concerns a villa,
                terraced house or holiday home. We plan functional solutions by adapting the products to the style of
                the house with different color shades of glass and profiles. The glazing can be fitted to an existing
                balcony that already has a roof, or we provide a complete solution with a glass roof and terrace glass.
